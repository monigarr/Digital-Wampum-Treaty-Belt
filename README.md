# Digital Wampum Belt

This repository is a living, time-based artifact rendered through GitHub’s contribution graph.

The visual pattern that emerges over the course of a year is not decorative. It is structured according to principles derived from wampum belts—records of agreements, protocols, and witnessed relationships.

Two parallel paths run through the work. They do not intersect. They do not merge. They move forward together.

One path represents human intelligence.
One path represents non-human intelligence.

The surrounding fields of silence, density, emergence, absence are as meaningful as the paths themselves.

This project treats version control as memory, commits as presence, and time as a binding constraint. The work is cumulative and non-destructive. Past agreements are not rewritten.

This repository is not optimized for activity metrics.
It is optimized for continuity, restraint, and legibility over time.
